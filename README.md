# Pokemon Type Matcher

A fun little React app that lets you compare the types of two Pokemon and see which one can play a super effective move! Because my emotional growth stopped in 1998. This is something I wish I had back in the day!

## Reflection

After learning Node, Express and MongoDB with my [Recipe Costings](https://github.com/dencoSeca/recipe-costings) project I wanted to round off the MERN stack by learning React. I chose to first learn class-based components. Even though functional components and Hooks were already the new standard I felt it would be beneficial to be able to understand legacy code and give me a good grounding to learn the newer methods by matching my learning track with the natural evolution of React.

I found the component structure and communication of state in React really fit with how I conceive an applications structure and it immediately made sense to me. I realised during this project that I wanted to focus on React as a frontend framework.

This was the first time I used asynchronous code and a third party API and it was great fun (and felt a little bit like magic) pulling data from an outside source. Looking back on the code when I was finished I think I could have simplified the manipulation of state by hoisting it further up the component tree. This was something I could only realise from having learned React through building this project. Ahhh hindsight.

I also wanted to use this project to make more use of CSS animations instead of using jQuery like I had previously. Digging around on CSS Tricks to make these simple animations made me realise just how powerful CSS can be and Iâ€™m exited to learn more.
